do not modify the file structure without reason (making a new folder for your code is not a valid reason)
- download git for git commands in terminal
- git clone to save a local copy of the repository for you to work on
- git pull if someone has uploaded updates to the branch you're working on (main is a branch)
  - git fetch if the updates really fuck up your code and you dont want to deal with merging until later

make a branch if you're working on a feature that can be isolated. if updates to the main are made that would affect your branch if applied you will need to rebase it

- if you fuck up badly, you can delete your branch
- if you fuck up badly, git will remember, there's version history, this is literally the version control site

- if you use chatgpt to generate any code i need a full and i mean FULL writeup of each and every function and variable and what they do. post it in the groupchat or some txt/word file alongside your code.
  - if you don't, im deleting it, fuck you.
- if you write your own code, just comment normally. if you dont understand what you wrote, it's ok! we can figure it out :)

if you fuck up the file structure ill fuck up your bone structure

You should separate content (XHTML), presentation (CSS), and behavior (JS). As much as possible, your
JS code should use styles from the CSS rather than manually setting each style property in the JS.
Implement the behavior of each onscreen control using JavaScript event handlers defined in your script
file. For full credit, you must write your code using unobtrusive JavaScript, so that no JavaScript code,
onclick handlers, etc. are embedded into the XHTML code.
